IAMath.java
-- classes implementing interval arithmetic versions of the arithmetic and elementary functions, as part of the "ia_math library" version 0.1beta1, 10/97
Copyright (C) 2000 Timothy J. Hickey
License: zlib/png
the class IAMath contains methods for performing basic
arithmetic operations on intervals. Currently the
elementary functions rely on the underlying implementation
which uses the netlib fdlibm library. The resulting code
is therefore probably unsound for the transcendental functions.
